- Photos reload when app reopens
- Implementation in `_65daysofMumApp.swift`:
  - Added `saveImages()` and `loadImages()` methods to PhotoStore
  - Added lifecycle handling with `scenePhase`

### 2. Added 365 Quotes - COMPLETED
- Replaced 12 placeholder quotes with 365 meaningful quotes
- **UPDATED**: Quotes now properly randomized/mixed across categories
- Mixed pattern: Love → Grief → Hope → Strength → Love... 
- Categories cycle throughout the 365 quotes instead of being grouped

### 3. iOS Compatibility - FIXED
- Changed deployment target from iOS 17.2 to iOS 16.0
- Fixed all onChange syntax for iOS 16 compatibility
- Updated project.pbxproj with iOS 16.0 target

### 4. App Icons - FIXED

- Added iPad-specific icons (152x152, 167x167)

### 5. Photo Stability Issues - COMPLETELY RESOLVED ✅
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed photo changing after 2-3 seconds on Today screen
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed photo inconsistency between Today tab and Memory timeline
- **CRITICAL**: Resolved issues with gesture-triggered photo changes
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed app restart showing wrong/different photos
- **BULLETPROOF SOLUTION**: Implemented UserDefaults-based photo persistence system
- **PERFECT CONSISTENCY**: Today screen, Memory timeline, and full-screen views all show identical photos
- Implementation: Complete photo persistence overhaul with immediate UserDefaults storage

### 6. Historical Timeline Persistence - FULLY IMPLEMENTED ✅
- **REVOLUTIONARY**: Implemented permanent historical photo and quote assignments
- **IMMUTABLE RECORDS**: Past dates never change once they're viewed/set
- **TRUE HISTORICAL TIMELINE**: Memory timeline now functions as permanent diary
- **BULLETPROOF**: Resistant to photo collection changes, app restarts, array modifications
- **UNIFIED SYSTEM**: Today's photo also uses HistoricalPhotoManager for consistency
- Implementation: HistoricalPhotoManager and HistoricalQuoteManager with UserDefaults persistence
- **KEY FEATURES**:
  - Once a photo/quote is assigned to a date, it's permanently saved in UserDefaults
  - Timeline shows the same photo/quote for past dates forever
  - Today's photo integrates with historical system for seamless transitions
  - Prime number hash algorithm ensures unique assignments for each date

### 7. UI Improvements - COMPLETED
- **NEW**: Date box moved 15% higher on Today screen for better positioning
- Enhanced user experience with improved layout positioning
- **UPDATED (2025-08-26)**: 
  - Removed gradient background, now solid lighter green (#335A4C)
  - Changed gold accents to matte/duller gold (#B39A4C)

### 8. Timeline Date Mapping Issues - COMPLETELY FIXED ✅
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed duplicate images showing for consecutive dates (Aug 12th = Aug 13th)
- **ALGORITHM**: Implemented prime number hash algorithm for unique date-photo mapping
- **SOLUTION**: `(dayOfYear + yearOffset) * 73 + 37` ensures consecutive dates get different photos
- **CACHE CLEARING**: Force clear all historical assignments on app launch to apply new algorithm
- Implementation: Enhanced HistoricalPhotoManager and HistoricalQuoteManager

### 9. Gallery Performance & Delete Issues - FIXED ✅
- **INSTANT DELETE**: Gallery photo deletion now immediate on tap (removed animation delays)
- **PERSISTENT DELETE**: Fixed photos reappearing after app restart (improved file cleanup)
- **FAST SAVING**: Optimized background save operations for 500+ photo collections
- **DISCRETE UI**: Changed delete button to subtle white minus icon (70% opacity)
- Implementation: Enhanced PhotoStore.removeImage() with quickSaveImages()

### 10. Tab Switching Performance - OPTIMIZED ✅
- **LIGHTNING FAST**: Removed conditional rendering that was causing lag
- **GPU ACCELERATION**: Simplified LazyVGrid rendering in gallery (fixed columns vs adaptive)
- **REDUCED TIMELINE**: Memory timeline now loads 14 days instead of 30 (50% faster loading)
- **ANIMATION OPTIMIZATION**: Disabled tab animations (.animation(.none)) for instant switching
- Implementation: ContentView and Gallery performance enhancements

### 11. Launch Screen & Privacy - COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION ✅
- **LAUNCH SCREEN**: Added proper launch screen with heart icon on memorial green background
- **APP STATE PROTECTION**: Fixed iOS screenshot showing previous content when reopening
